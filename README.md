# Vehicle CAN Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 🚗 Why This Project?

Modern vehicles rely heavily on the Controller Area Network (CAN bus) to enable communication between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). However, the CAN bus protocol was **not originally designed with built-in security**, which leaves it vulnerable to attacks such as **spoofing, Denial-of-Service (DoS), and replay attacks**.

This project demonstrates how **machine learning and deep learning techniques** can be applied to detect such intrusions in real time, thereby enhancing vehicle cybersecurity.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Simulated various CAN bus attacks including **spoofing, DoS, and replay attacks**, and collected realistic CAN log data.
- Performed data processing and cleaning on the CAN datasets to prepare them for machine learning training.
- Extracted relevant features using a **window-based parameter extraction** method for efficient real-time intrusion detection.
- Trained and compared multiple models including:
  - Traditional ML: **Random Forest, Extra Trees, LightGBM, XGBoost**
  - Deep Learning: **CNN, DNN, LSTM**
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- Provided trained model files (`.joblib`, `.pkl`, `.h5`) for reuse and further experimentation.
